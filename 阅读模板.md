The longest bull run in a century of art-market history ended on a dramatic note with a sale of 56 works by Damien Hirst, Beautiful Inside My Head Forever, at Sotheby's in London on September 15 th 2008. All but two pieces sold, fetching more than £70 m, a record for a sale by a single artist. It was a last victory. As the auctioneer called out bids, in New York one of the oldest banks on Wall Street, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy.
2008 年 9 月 15 日，在伦敦苏富比拍卖行举办的“我脑海中永恒的美”主题拍卖会上，随着达米恩·赫斯特的 56 件作品被拍卖，一个世纪以来艺术品市场史上最长的牛市戏剧性地落幕了。除两件作品以外，其余作品全部售出，拍卖总额超过七千万英镑，创造了单个艺术家作品拍卖的最高纪录。这是最后的胜利。在拍卖师喊出报价的同时，纽约华尔街历史最悠久的银行之一雷曼兄弟申请了破产。

The world art market had already been losing momentum for a while after rising bewilderingly since 2003. At its peak in 2007 it was worth some $65 billion, reckons Clare McAndrew, founder of Arts Economics, a research firm—double the figure five years earlier. Since then it may have come down to $50 billion. But the market generates interest far beyond its size because it brings together great wealth, enormous egos, greed, passion and controversy in a way matched by few other industries.
自 2003 年以来令人费解地增长之后，世界艺术品市场的发展势头持续减弱了相当长的一段时间。据艺术经济学研究公司的创始人克莱尔·麦克安德鲁估算，在 2007 年的顶峰时期，艺术品市场价值约为 650 亿美元，是五年前的两倍。从那以后，该价值可能已降至 500 亿美元。但这一市场产生的利益远远超出它本身的规模，因为它将巨额财富、自负、贪婪、激情和争议以一种其他行业无法比拟的方式汇集在了一起。


In the weeks and months that followed Mr. Hirst's sale, spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable. In the art world that meant collectors stayed away from galleries and salerooms. Sales of contemporary art fell by two-thirds, and in the most overheated sector, they were down by nearly 90\% in the year to November 2008. Within weeks the world's two biggest auction houses, Sotheby's and Christie's, had to pay out nearly \$200 m in guarantees to clients who had placed works for sale with them.
赫斯特作品拍卖之后的一段时间内，任何种类的消费都变得极其不合时宜。在艺术品领域，这意味着收藏家不再光顾画廊和拍卖场。2008 年当年截至 11 月，当代艺术品的销售额下降了 2/3，而在其最热门的领域则下降了近  $90\%$  。几周之内，全球最大的两家拍卖行，苏富比和佳士得，不得不支付将近 2 亿美元的保证金给那些将艺术品交由它们售卖的客户。

22. By saying "spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable" (Line 1-2, Para. 3), the author suggests that

The current downturn in the art market is the worst since the Japanese stopped buying Impressionists at the end of 1989. This time experts reckon that prices are about 40\% down on their peak on average, though some have been far more fluctuant. But Edward Dolman, Christie's chief executive, says: "I'm pretty confident we're at the bottom."
当前艺术品市场的下滑是自 1989 年底日本人停止购买印象派作品以来最严重的一次。专家估测此次艺术品的价格较之其峰值平均下跌了约  $40\%$  ，且有些艺术品的价格波动幅度更大。但是佳士得的首席执行官爱德华·杜尔曼说：“我非常确信我们现在已处于谷底。”


What makes this slump different from the last, he says, is that there are still buyers in the market. Almost everyone who was interviewed for this special report said that the biggest problem at the moment is not a lack of demand but a lack of good work to sell. The three Ds—death, debt and divorce—still deliver works of art to the market. But anyone who does not have to sell is keeping away, waiting for confidence to return.
他说，此次衰退不同于上次是因为现在市场上仍然有买家。几乎所有接受此次特别报道采访的人都说，当前最大的问题不是缺少需求，而是缺少好的售卖作品。三个 D——死亡、债务和离婚——依然是将艺术品推向市场的三大因素。但那些不是非卖不可的人都在远离市场，等待市场信心的回归。
