The most thoroughly studied intellectuals in the history of the New World are the ministers and political leaders of seventeenth-century New England. According to the standard history of American philosophy, nowhere else in colonial America was "so much importance attached to intellectual pursuits." According to many books and articles, New England's leaders established the basic themes and preoccupations of an unfolding, dominant Puritan tradition in American intellectual life.
新世界历史上被研究得最彻底的知识分子是 17 世纪新英格兰的牧师和政治领袖。根据美国哲学的标准历史记载，在殖民地时期的美洲，没有其他任何地方像这里一样“如此重文化追求”。根据许多书籍和文章的记载，新英格兰的领袖们确立了美国文化生活中一种不断发展的、占主导地位的清教徒传统的基本主题和关注点。

To take this approach to the New Englanders normally means to start with the Puritans' theological innovations and their distinctive ideas about the church—important subjects that we may not neglect. But in keeping with our examination of southern intellectual life, we may consider the original Puritans as carriers of European culture, adjusting to New World circumstances. The New England colonies were the scenes of important episodes in the pursuit of widely understood ideals of civility and virtuosity.
对待新英格兰人采取这种方法通常意味着从清教徒的神学创新和他们关于教会的独特思想开始——这些是我们不能忽视的重要课题。但是，为了与我们要考察的南方文化生活保持一致，我们可以把最初的清教徒看作是欧洲文化的传播者，他们正在适应新世界的环境。新英格兰殖民地是在追求广泛理解的文明和精湛技艺理想方面发生重要事件的场所。


The early settlers of Massachusetts Bay included men of impressive education and influence in England. Besides the ninety or so learned ministers who came to Massachusetts churches in the decade after 1629, there were political leaders like John Winthrop, an educated gentleman, lawyer, and official of the Crown before he journeyed to Boston. These men wrote and published extensively, reaching both New World and Old World audiences, and giving New England an atmosphere of intellectual earnestness.
马萨诸塞湾的早期定居者包括一些在英国受过良好教育且有影响力的人。除了在 1629 年后的十年间来到马萨诸塞教堂的约 90 位博学的牧师外，还有像约翰·温思罗普这样的政治领袖，他在前往波士顿之前是一位受过教育的绅士、律师和王室官员。这些人撰写并出版了大量的著作，读者遍及新大陆和旧大陆，给新英格兰带来了一种求知若渴的氛围。

We should not forget, however, that most New Englanders were less well educated. While few craftsmen or farmers, let alone dependents and servants, left literary compositions to be analyzed, it is obvious that their views were less fully intellectualized. Their thinking often had a traditional superstitious quality. A tailor named John Dane, who emigrated in the late 1630 s, left an account of his reasons for leaving England that is filled with signs. Sexual confusion, economic frustrations, and religious hope—all came together in a decisive moment when he opened the Bible, told his father that the first line he saw would settle his fate, and read the magical words: “Come out from among them, touch no unclean thing, and I will be your God and you shall be my people.” One wonders what Dane thought of the careful sermons explaining the Bible that he heard in Puritan churches.
然而，我们不应忘记，大多数新英格兰人受教育程度较低。虽然很少有工匠或农民，更不用说家眷和仆人，留下文学作品供人分析，但显而易见的是，他们的观点并不那么理智。他们的思想通常具有一种传统的迷信色彩。一位名叫约翰·戴恩的裁缝在 17 世纪 30 年代末移民，他留下了一份关于他离开英国原因的叙述，其中充满了征兆。性困惑、经济挫折和宗教希望——所有这些都在一个决定性的时刻汇聚在一起，当时他打开《圣经》，告诉他的父亲通过他看到的第一行文字来决定他的命运，然后读到了这些神奇的话语：“从他们中间出来，不要沾不洁净的物，我就作你们的神，你们就作我的子民。’人们不禁想知道，戴恩对他在清教徒教堂里听到的那些严谨解释《圣经》的布道有何感想。”

Meanwhile, many settlers had slighter religious commitments than Dane's, as one clergyman learned in confronting folk along the coast who mocked that they had not come to the New World for religion. "Our main end was to catch fish."
与此同时，许多定居者的宗教信仰比戴恩还要淡薄，正如一位牧师在面对沿海居民时所了解到的那样，这些居民嘲笑说他们来新世界并不是为了宗教。“我们的主要目的是捕鱼。”
