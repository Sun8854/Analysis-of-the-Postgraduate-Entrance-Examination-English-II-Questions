Coinciding with the groundbreaking theory of biological evolution proposed by British naturalist Charles Darwin in the 1860s, British social philosopher Herbert Spencer put forward his own theory of biological and cultural evolution. Spencer argued that all worldly phenomena, including human societies, changed over time, advancing toward perfection. (41)

在英国博物学家查尔斯·达尔文于19 世纪 60 年代提出开创性生物进化论的同时，英国社会哲学家赫伯特·斯宾塞也提出了自己的生物和文化进化理论。斯宾塞认为，世间万象，包括人类社会，都随着时间而变化，趋向完善。(41)

American social scientist Lewis Henry Morgan introduced another theory of cultural evolution in the late 1800s. Morgan helped found modern anthropology—the scientific study of human societies, customs and beliefs—thus becoming one of the earliest anthropologists. In his work, he attempted to show how all aspects of culture changed together in the evolution of societies. (42)

美国社会科学家刘易斯·亨利·摩尔根在 19 世纪末提出了另一种文化进化理论。摩尔根帮助创立了现代人类学——对人类社会、习俗和信仰的科学研究——因此成为最早的人类学家之一。在他的著作中，他试图说明文化的各个方面是如何随着社会的进化而共同发生变化的。(42)

In the early 1900s in North America, German-born American anthropologist Franz Boas developed a new theory of culture known as historical particularism. Historical particularism, which emphasized the uniqueness of all cultures, gave new direction to anthropology. (43)

在 20 世纪初期的北美，德裔美国人类学家弗朗茨·博尼斯详尽阐述了一种新的文化理论，被称作历史特殊论。历史特殊论强调所有文化的独特性，为人类学指明了新方向。(43)

Boas felt that the culture of any society must be understood as the result of a unique history and not as one of many cultures belonging to a broader evolutionary stage or type of culture. (44)

博尼斯认为任何社会的文化都必须被理解为某一独特历史的产物，而不是同属于某一更广义的进化阶段或者文化类型的许多文化之一。(44)

Historical particularism became a dominant approach to the study of culture in American anthropology, largely through the influence of many students of Boas. But a number of anthropologists in the early 1900s also rejected the particularist theory of culture in favor of diffusionism. Some attributed virtually every important cultural achievement to the inventions of a few, especially gifted peoples that, according to diffusionists, then spread to other cultures. (45)

主要由于博尼斯众多学生的影响力，历史特殊论成为美国人类学文化研究中占主导地位的方法。但是 20 世纪初也有许多人类学家反对文化特殊论，赞同文化传播论。有些人类学家将几乎每项重要的文化成就都归因于少数、尤其是有天赋的民族的发明创造，根据传播论者的看法，这些发明后来传播到其它的文化中。(45)

Also in the early 1900s, French sociologist Émile Durkheim developed a theory of culture that would greatly influence anthropology. Durkheim proposed that religious beliefs functioned to reinforce social solidarity. An interest in the relationship between the function of society and culture became a major theme in European, and especially British, anthropology.

同样在 20 世纪初，法国社会学家埃米尔·涂尔干详细阐述了一种对人类学产生极大影响的文化理论。涂尔干提出，宗教信仰具有加强社会关联性的功能。对社会功能与文化之间关联的关注成为欧洲，尤其是英国人类学研究的一大主题。

[A] Other anthropologists believed that cultural innovations, such as inventions, had a single origin and passed from society to society. This theory was known as diffusionism. 

[A] 其他人类学家认为文化创新，比如发明，具有单一一起源，从一个社会传播到另一个社会。这一理论被称为文化传播论。

[B] In order to study particular cultures as completely as possible, he became skilled in linguistics, the study of languages, and in physical anthropology, the study of human biology and anatomy. 

[B] 为了尽可能全面地研究特定的文化，他熟练掌握了语言学（对语言的研究）和体质人类学（对人体生理特征和解剖结构的研究）。

[C] He argued that human evolution was characterized by a struggle he called the "survival of the fittest," in which weaker races and societies must eventually be replaced by stronger, more advanced races and societies. 

[C] 他认为人类进化的特点在于他称之为“适者生存”的竞争，在这场竞争中，弱小的种族和社会终将被更强大、更先进的种族和社会所取代。

[D] They also focused on important rituals that appeared to preserve a people's social structure, such as initiation ceremonies that formally signify children's entrance into adulthood. 

[D] 他们还关注似乎维系着一个民族社会结构的重要仪式，比如标志孩子正式进入成年期的成人典礼。

[E] Thus, in his view, diverse aspects of culture, such as the structure of families, forms of marriage, categories of kinship, ownership of property, forms of government, technology, and systems of food production, all changed as societies evolved. 

[E] 因此，在他看来，文化的各个方面，诸如家庭结构、婚姻形式、亲属分类、财产所有权、政府形式、技术、食品生产体系等，都随着社会的进化而改变。

[F] Supporters of the theory viewed culture as a collection of integrated parts that work together to keep a society functioning. 

[F] 该理论的支持者将文化视为各部分有机结合、共同维持社会正常运行的集合体。

[G] For example, British anthropologists Grafton Elliot Smith and W. J. Perry incorrectly suggested, on the basis of inadequate information, that farming, pottery making, and metallurgy all originated in ancient Egypt and diffused throughout the world. In fact, all of these cultural developments occurred separately at different times in many parts of the world.

[G] 比如，英国人类学家格拉夫顿·E·史密斯和 W·J·佩里在信息不足的基础上错误地指出，农耕、制陶、冶金都源于古埃及，然后传播至全世界。事实上，所有这些文化成就分别于不同时期在世界多地出现。
