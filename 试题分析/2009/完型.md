Research on animal intelligence always makes us wonder just how smart humans are. 1 the fruit-fly experiments described by Carl Zimmer in the Science Times. Fruit flies who were taught to be smarter than the average fruit fly 2 to live shorter lives. This suggests that 3 bulbs burn longer, that there is a (n) 4 in not being too bright.
关于动物智力的研究总是让我们想知道人类到底有多聪明。1 卡尔·齐默在《科学时报》上描述的果蝇实验。被教得比普通果蝇更聪明的果蝇 2 寿命更短。这表明 3 灯泡亮得更久，不那么聪明是有 4 的。

Intelligence, it 5 , is a high-priced option. It takes more upkeep, burns more fuel and is slow 6 the starting line because it depends on learning-a (n) 7 process--instead of instinct. Plenty of other species are able to learn, and one of the things they've apparently learned is when to 8 .

Is there an adaptive value to 9 intelligence? That's the question behind this new research. Instead of casting a wistful glance 10 at all the species we've left in the dust I.Q.-wise, it implicitly asks what the real 11 of our own intelligence might be. This is 12 the mind of every animal we've ever met.
9 智力有适应性价值吗？这是这项新研究背后的问题。与其对所有我们在智商方面抛在后面的物种投以 10 的一瞥，不如含蓄地问我们自己智力的真正 11 可能是多少。这 12 我们遇到的每一种动物的头脑。

Research on animal intelligence also makes us wonder what experiments animals would 13 on humans if they had the chance. Every cat with an owner, 14, is running a small-scale study in operant conditioning. We believe that 15 animals ran the labs, they would test us to 16 the limits of our patience, our faithfulness, our memory for locations. They would try to decide what intelligence in humans is really 17, not merely how much of it there is. 18, they would hope to study a (n) 19 question: Are humans actually aware of the world they live in? 20 the results are inconclusive.
对动物智力的研究也让我们想知道，如果有机会，动物会在人类身上 13 什么实验。每只有主人的猫，14 ，都在进行一项关于操作性条件反射的小规模研究。我们相信，15 动物管理实验室，它们会测试我们以 16 我们的耐心、忠诚度和对位置记忆的极限。它们会试图确定人类的智力真正是 17 ，而不仅仅是有多少。18 ，它们会希望研究一个 19 问题：人类真的意识到他们生活的世界吗？20 结果是不确定的。
