Both Boeing and Airbus have trumpeted the efficiency of their newest aircraft, the 787 and A 350 respectively. Their clever designs and lightweight composites certainly make a difference. But a group of researchers at Stanford University, led by Ilan Kroo, has suggested that airlines could take a more naturalistic approach to cutting jet-fuel use, and it would not require them to buy new aircraft.

波音公司和空中客车公司都在大肆宣扬他们各自的最新飞机（波音787和空客A350）的效率。两者的巧妙设计和轻型复合材料的使用无疑（对飞行效率的提高）起到一定作用。不过由伊兰·克鲁带领的斯坦福大学的一个研究小组提出，航空公司可以采取更贴近自然的（仿生)方法降低航油的消耗，而且这种方法也使航空公司无需购买新型飞机。

41. Findings of the Stanford University researchers will promote the sales of new Boeing and Airbus aircraft.

41. 斯坦福大学研究者的发现将对波音和空客的新型客机起到促销作用。

The answer, says Dr Kroo, lies with birds. Since 1914, scientists have known that birds flying in formation—a V-shape—expend less energy. The air flowing over a bird's wings curls upwards behind the wingtips, a phenomenon known as upwash. Other birds flying in the upwash experience reduced drag, and spend less energy propelling themselves. Peter Lissaman, an aeronautics expert who was formerly at Caltech and the University of Southern California, has suggested that a formation of 25 birds might enjoy a range increase of  $71\%$ .

克鲁博士说，问题的解决与飞鸟密切相关。自1914年起，科学家就已经了解到鸟类在以V字队形飞行时耗能较少。鸟翼上方的气流在翼尖后方向上盘旋，这种现象被称作气流上洗。其他在上洗流中飞行的鸟儿受到的阻力会减弱，这样在推动自身向前飞行时能够消耗较少能量。曾在加州理工学院及南加州大学任职的航空专家皮特·李萨曼指出，一支由25只飞鸟组成的编队可能使其飞行距离增加  $71\%$  。

42. The upwash experience may save propelling energy as well as reducing resistance.

42. 在上洗流中飞行或许能够降低飞行能耗，同时也能减少阻力。

When applied to aircraft, the principles are not substantially different. Dr Kroo and his team modelled what would happen if three passenger jets departing from Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas were to assemble over Utah, assume an inverted V-formation, occasionally change places so all could have a turn in the most favourable positions, and proceed to London. They found that the aircraft consumed as much as  $15\%$  less fuel (coupled with a reduction in carbon-dioxide output). Nitrogen-oxide emissions during the cruising portions of the flight fell by around a quarter.

当应用于飞机时，其原理并没有本质区别。克鲁博士及其团队做了一项模拟实验——从洛杉矶、旧金山以及拉斯维加斯起飞的三架客机在犹他州上方会合，采取倒V字队形前进，偶尔交换位置以确保每架飞机轮流位于最佳位置，以此方式向伦敦飞行——从而了解会发生什么情况。他们发现飞机节省了高达  $15\%$  的燃油（同时二氧化碳的排放量也有所减少）。巡航飞行阶段的氮氧化物排放量减少了约四分之一。

There are, of course, knots to be worked out. One consideration is safety, or at least the perception of it. Would passengers feel comfortable travelling in companion? Dr Kroo points out that the aircraft could be separated by several nautical miles, and would not be in the intimate groupings favoured by display teams like the Red Arrows. A passenger peering out of the window might not even see the other planes. Whether the separation distances involved would satisfy air-traffic-control regulations is another

matter, although a working group at the International Civil Aviation Organisation has included the possibility of formation flying in a blueprint for new operational guidelines.

当然，这其中有些难点要解决。其中要考虑的问题之一便是安全问题，或者说至少是安全感的问题。乘客会对飞机结伴飞行感到自在吗？克鲁博士指出，飞机之间可能会相隔几海里，不会像“红箭”等飞行表演队那样常常以紧密编队方式飞行。仔细望向窗外的乘客甚至可能都看不到其他飞机。至于飞机飞行间距是否符合空中交通管制规定则是另一个问题，不过国际民航组织的一个工作小组已经将编队飞行的可能性纳入了新业务指导方案之中。

43. Formation flight is more comfortable because passengers can not see the other planes.

43. 编队飞行更舒适，因为乘客看不到其他飞机。

It remains to be seen how weather conditions affect the air flows that make formation flight more efficient. In zones of increased turbulence, the planes' wakes will decay more quickly and the effect will diminish. Dr Kroo says this is one of the areas his team will investigate further. It might also be hard for airlines to co-ordinate the departure times and destinations of passenger aircraft in a way that would allow them to gain from formation flight. Cargo aircraft, in contrast, might be easier to reschedule, as might routine military flights.

天气状况如何影响使编队飞行更高效的气流，尚待观望。在强紊流区域，飞机的尾迹消散得更快，其（上洗）作用也将减弱。克鲁博士说，这一问题是我们团队将深入研究的领域之一。此外，各航空公司可能也很难协调客机的起飞时间和目的地，以使它们能够从编队飞行中获益。相比之下，货运飞机可能更容易重新计划协调，例行军事飞行可能也是如此。

44. The role that weather plays in formation flight has not yet been clearly defined.

44. 天气对编队飞行的影响尚不明确。

As it happens, America's armed forces are on the case already. Earlier this year the country's Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency announced plans to pay Boeing to investigate formation flight, though the programme has yet to begin. There are reports that some military aircraft flew in formation when they were low on fuel during the Second World War, but Dr Lissaman says they are unsubstantiated. "My father was an RAF pilot and my cousin the skipper of a Lancaster lost over Berlin," he adds. So he should know.

事实上，美国军队已经在研究这一问题了。美国国防高级研究计划局于今年早些时候宣布了调拨资金以供波音公司研究编队飞行的计划，不过这一项目尚未启动。有传闻称二战时期某些军用飞机在燃油不足的情况下曾以编队方式飞行，但是李萨曼博士说这些传闻并无事实依据。“我的父亲是英国皇家空军的飞行员；我的堂兄是兰开斯特轰炸机的机长，在柏林上空被击落。”他补充道。因此他应该了解情况。

45. It has been documented that during World War II, America's armed forces once tried formation flight to save fuel.

45. 有记载表明二战期间，美军曾经尝试编队飞行以节省燃油。
