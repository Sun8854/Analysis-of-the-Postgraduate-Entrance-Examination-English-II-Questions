"Sustainability" has become a popular word these days, but to Ted Ning, the concept will always have personal meaning.

Having endured a painful period of unsustainability in his own life made it clear to him that sustainability-oriented values must be expressed through everyday action and choice.

Ning recalls spending a confusing year in the late 1990s selling insurance. He'd been through the dot-com boom and burst and, desperate for a job, signed on with a Boulder agency.

It didn't go well. "It was a really bad move because that's not my passion," says Ning, whose dilemma about the job translated, predictably, into a lack of sales. 
<font color="#00b0f0">我没有做好，Ning 说：“它向一个非常不好的方向移动，因为我对那没有激情，”预测他转行的事故将使他销量不足。</font>

"I was miserable. I had so much anxiety that I would wake up in the middle of the night and stare at the ceiling. I had no money and needed the job. Everyone said, 'Just wait, you'll turn the corner, give it some time.'"
<font color="#00b0f0">“我是错误的，我太焦虑了以至于我在午夜中醒来并盯着天花板。我没有钱并且需要工作。每个人都说，‘耐心等待，你将会迎来转机，给他一点时间。’”</font>
