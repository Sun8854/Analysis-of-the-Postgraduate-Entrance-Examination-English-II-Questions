^^^article
I was addressing a small gathering in a suburban Virginia living room—a women's group that had invited men to join them. Throughout the evening, one man had been particularly talkative, frequently offering ideas and anecdotes, while his wife sat silently beside him on the couch. Toward the end of the evening, I commented that women frequently complain that their husbands don't talk to them. This man quickly nodded in agreement. He gestured toward his wife and said, "She's the talker in our family." The room burst into laughter; the man looked puzzled and hurt. "It's true," he explained. "When I come home from work I have nothing to say. If she didn't keep the conversation going, we'd spend the whole evening in silence."
我那天正在弗吉尼亚郊区一间会客室的一场小型聚会上发表演讲——聚会的举办者是一个女性团体，男性也在受邀之列。整个晚上，有位男士格外健谈，频频发表看法，讲述趣闻轶事，而他的妻子则坐在他旁边的沙发上一言不发。聚会接近尾声时，我评论说女士们经常会抱怨丈夫不与自己交谈。这位男士立即点头表示同意。他指着妻子说：“我们家她是话匣子。”这引起了哄堂大笑；这位男士（却）一脸茫然和委屈。“这是真的。”他解释说，“我下班回到家后，就没什么话可说。如果不是她让谈话进行下去，我们整晚都会在沉默中度过。”


This episode crystallizes the irony that although American men tend to talk more than women in public situations, they often talk less at home. And this pattern is wreaking havoc with marriage.
这段插曲反映出一个具有讽刺意味的现象：尽管美国男性在公共场合往往比女性更加健谈，他们在家里却很少说话。而这种交流模式正在严重破坏婚姻。

27. Judging from the context, the phrase “wreaking havoc” (Line 3, Para. 2) most probably means ________.

28. 从上下文判断,词组 wreaking havoc(第二段第三行)最可能的含义是___。

	[A] generating motivation
	[A]产生动力

	[B] exerting influence
	[B]施加影响

	[C] causing damage
	[C]造成破坏

	[D] creating pressure
	[D]形成压力


The pattern was observed by political scientist Andrew Hacker in the late 1970 s. Sociologist Catherine Kohler Riessman reports in her new book Divorce Talk that most of the women she interviewed—but only a few of the men—gave lack of communication as the reason for their divorces. Given the current divorce rate of nearly 50 percent, that amounts to millions of cases in the United States every year—a virtual epidemic of failed conversation.
政治学家安德鲁·海克在20世纪70年代末就观察到了这种模式。社会学家凯瑟琳·科勒·里斯曼在她的新书《离婚谈》中指出，她所采访的大多数女性会把离婚归咎于缺乏沟通，但只有少数几位男性如此认为。考虑到美国目前的离婚率已接近  $50\%$  ，这等同于每年有数百万起离婚——实质上就是一场沟通不良流行病。

28. All of the following are true EXCEPT _.

29. 下面与原文内容不符的一项是 _.

	[A] men tend to talk more in public than women
	[A] 男性在公共场合往往比女性更加健谈

	[B] nearly 50 percent of recent divorces are caused by failed conversation
	[B] 近来离婚案例中,近50%是由沟通不良导致的

	[C] women attach much importance to communication between couples
	[C] 女性非常看重夫妻间的沟通

	[D] a female tends to be more talkative at home than her spouse
	[D] 女性在家中往往比其配偶更加健谈


In my own research, complaints from women about their husbands most often focused not on tangible inequities such as having given up the chance for a career to accompany a husband to his, or doing far more than their share of daily life-support work like cleaning, cooking and social arrangements. Instead, they focused on communication: “He doesn’t listen to me.” “He doesn’t talk to me.” I found, as Hacker observed years before, that most wives want their husbands to be, first and foremost, conversational partners, but few husbands share this expectation of their wives.
根据我个人的研究，女性对丈夫的抱怨大多数时候并非集中于那些看得见摸得着的不平等，比如为了陪伴丈夫发展事业而放弃了开启自己事业的机会，或者承担了绝大部分日常生活琐事，如打扫卫生、烧菜做饭、安排社交活动。相反，她们的抱怨集中在“交流”问题上，如“他不听我说话”或“他不和我说话”。就像海克多年前就观察到的一样，我发现多数妻子都希望丈夫首先是自己的交谈伙伴，但很少有丈夫对妻子抱有同样的期望。

26. What is most wives' main expectation of their husbands?

27. 大多数妻子对丈夫最大的期待是什么?

	[A] Talking to them.

	[D] Sharing housework.
	[D] 分担家务。


In short, the image that best represents the current crisis is the stereotypical cartoon scene of a man sitting at the breakfast table with a newspaper held up in front of his face, while a woman glares at the back of it, wanting to talk.
简言之，最能形象表现目前这种危机的是这样一幅老套的漫画场景：一个男人坐在早餐桌边，手里的报纸挡住了他的脸；与此同时，一个女人生气地瞪着报纸背面，很想说话。

	[D] Conversational patterns between man and wife are different.
	[D] 夫妻双方的交流模式互不相同。
