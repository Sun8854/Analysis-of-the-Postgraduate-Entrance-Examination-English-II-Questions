Many Americans regard the jury system as a concrete expression of crucial democratic values, including the principles that all citizens who meet minimal qualifications of age and literacy are equally competent to serve on juries; that jurors should be selected randomly from a representative cross section of the community; that no citizen should be denied the right to serve on a jury on account of race, religion, sex, or national origin; that defendants are entitled to trial by their peers; and that verdicts should represent the conscience of the community and not just the letter of the law. The jury is also said to be the best surviving example of direct rather than representative democracy. In a direct democracy, citizens take turns governing themselves, rather than electing representatives to govern for them.
许多美国人把陪审团制度看作是至关重要的民主价值观的具体体现，这一制度包含以下原则：所有满足最低年龄和文化要求的公民都同样具备担任陪审员的能力；陪审员应从（被告所在）社区的典型代表中随机挑选；任何公民不得由于种族、宗教、性别和籍裔被剥夺担任陪审员的权利；被告人有权接受同等地位的人的审判；审判结果应体现社区的良知，而不仅仅反映法律的准确字面意义。陪审团还被称为是现存的体现直接民主而非代议制民主的最佳典范。在实行直接民主的国家中，公民轮流进行自治，而不是选举代表来替自己管理。

36. From the principles of the US jury system, we learn that _.

	[A] both literate and illiterate people can serve on juries
	[A] 有文化的人和文盲都可以担任陪审员

	[D] judgment should consider the opinion of the public
	[D] 判决应考虑公众意见


But as recently as in 1968, jury selection procedures conflicted with these democratic ideals. In some states, for example, jury duty was limited to persons of supposedly superior intelligence, education, and moral character. Although the Supreme Court of the United States had prohibited intentional racial discrimination in jury selection as early as the 1880 case of Strauder v. West Virginia, the practice of selecting so-called elite or blue-ribbon juries provided a convenient way around this and other antidiscrimination laws.
但就在最近的1968年，陪审团的遴选程序还仍然是和这些民主理想相冲突的。例如，在某些州，陪审团职责仅限由智力、教育程度和品德据说都高人一等的人来承担。尽管美国最高法院早在1880年的斯特劳德诉西弗吉尼亚州一案中就已经禁止了陪审团遴选中的蓄意种族歧视，但挑选组成所谓精英或者蓝绶带陪审团的做法，却为绕开这一反歧视法以及其他反歧视法提供了一条捷径。

37. The practice of selecting so-called elite jurors prior to 1968 showed _.

37. 1968 年之前的选拔所谓精英陪审员的做法表明_。

	[A] the inadequacy of antidiscrimination laws
	[A] 反歧视法律的不完备

	[B] the prevalent discrimination against certain races
	[B] 对某些种族的普遍歧视

	[C] the conflicting ideals in jury selection procedures
	[C] 陪审团选拔程序中自相矛盾的理念

	[D] the arrogance common among the Supreme Court judges
	[D] 最高法院法官中常见的傲慢


The system also failed to regularly include women on juries until the mid-20th century. Although women first served on state juries in Utah in 1898, it was not until the 1940s that a majority of states made women eligible for jury duty. Even then several states automatically exempted women from jury duty unless they personally asked to have their names included on the jury list. This practice was justified by the claim that women were needed at home, and it kept juries unrepresentative of women through the 1960s.
此外，直到20世纪中叶，陪审团制度才经常性地允许女性担任陪审员。虽然早在1898年，犹他州就首次有女性担任陪审员，但直到20世纪40年代，大部分州才赋予了女性担任陪审员的资格。即便到那时，有些州还是自动免除了女性的陪审员义务，除非她们自己要求将名字列入陪审团名单。这种做法的正当性来自女性应专事家务这一（颇具争议性的）论断，它使得整个20世纪60年代的陪审团中都鲜有女性代表。

38. Even in the 1960s, women were seldom on the jury list in some states because _.

38. 即便20世纪60年代,女性仍很少出现在某些州的陪审团名单上,这是因为_。

	[A] they were automatically banned by state laws

	[B] they fell far short of the required qualifications
	[B] 她们远不具备要求的条件

	[C] they were supposed to perform domestic duties
	[C] 她们被认为应承担家庭职责

	[D] they tended to evade public engagement
	[D] 她们往往逃避公众事务


In 1968, the Congress of the United States passed the Jury Selection and Service Act, ushering in a new era of democratic reforms for the jury. This law abolished special educational requirements for federal jurors and required them to be selected at random from a cross section of the entire community. In the landmark 1975 decision Taylor v. Louisiana, the Supreme Court extended the requirement that juries be representative of all parts of the community to the state level. The Taylor decision also declared sex discrimination in jury selection to be unconstitutional and ordered states to use the same procedures for selecting male and female jurors.
1968年，美国国会表决通过了《陪审团遴选与服务法》，从此开辟了一个陪审团民主改革的新时代。这一法案废除了对联邦政府陪审员的特殊教育要求，要求从整个社区的典型代表中随机挑选。在1975年泰勒诉路易斯安那州一案具有里程碑意义的裁定中，最高法院将“陪审团应代表社区各群体”这一要求延伸至了州级层面。泰勒案的裁决同时宣告陪审团遴选中的性别歧视违宪，并命令各州选拔男、女陪审员时必须采用相同的程序。

39. After the Jury Selection and Service Act was passed, _.

39.《陪审团遴选与服务法》通过之后,_。

	[A] sex discrimination in jury selection was unconstitutional and had to be abolished
